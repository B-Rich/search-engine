Top priority:
* Read the doc: en version
* math on-disk posting file compression
* math index on a filesystem that does not restrict number of inodes.
* search earily termination (depends on how many items has been evaluated).
* breadth-first dir-merge
* score: frequency & [sub_expr depth > score (mnc_score / search_depth) > n_lr_paths]
* top level AND merge does not work
* oprtr decompose (when no search result is found)
* malloc hook / valgrind check
* Traffic stat / query log

Want to implement:
* search: concept search (horse == Pony)
* spell checking & 3-gram input suggestion
* query correction ("do you mean XXX")

Do it when time is allowed:
* faster Chinese tokenizer
* faster math-index/subpath-set
* in mnc_score, compare father-to-root hash
* efficient postmerge

Top priority:
* docID, termID used to get highlight position.
* faster Chinese tokenizer
* crawler
* blob-index (libz compress)
* search daemon

* math posting file compression
* force query lower case to avoid Indri crash.

Want to implement:
* search: concept search (horse == Pony) and phrase&proximity search
* spell checking & 3-gram input suggestion
* query correction ("do you mean XXX")

Do it when time is allowed:
* malloc hook
* oprtr decompose (when no search result is found)
* faster math-index/subpath-set
* breadth-first dir-merge
* in mnc_score, compare father-to-root hash

Top priority:
* math score anchor posting
* crawler
* math posting file compression
* uppercase highlight miss.
* math query "aa" crash
* breadth-first dir-merge

Want to implement:
* search: concept search (horse == Pony)
* spell checking & 3-gram input suggestion
* query correction ("do you mean XXX")

Do it when time is allowed:
* faster Chinese tokenizer
* malloc hook
* oprtr decompose (when no search result is found)
* faster math-index/subpath-set
* in mnc_score, compare father-to-root hash
